# SpongeCreeperHeal

SpongeCreeperHeal is a *Work In Progress* project, source are not available yet due to current unstabilities.
SpongeCreeperHeal is not only a porting of [ForgeCreeperHeal](https://github.com/RedRelay/ForgeCreeperHeal) from Forge to Sponge.
It is a complete code refactoring to make it easier to understand and to contribute.
SpongeCreeperHeal started 18 jully 2018, at the same date of Minecraft 1.13 ! (Was completely uncalculated)

With a lot of new skill in develpment, I will put the best of I could in this plugin.

I don't use Java since 2017, I'm now a professionnal JavaScript devlopper for a leader e-commerce compagny in France.
As Minecraft is java coded, I will use Java with some functionnal programming I've learned from JS. E.g -> Lambda !

## When the code and the Sponge plugin will be available ?

I need to create a strong functionnal base before publishing the code.
Here is a base roadmap :

- [x] Implement a per chunk / per explosion blockSnapshots stucture
- [x] Handle tick and consume healable objects
- [x] Restore a blockSnapshot
- [ ] Persist data
- [ ] Create a dependency engine and sort blocks
- [ ] Healing clock configuration

When all theses task will be done, the code will be published.
I've planned additionnal develpments :

- [ ] Healing commands
- [ ] Simulate block healing with chunk is not loaded

Stay tuned :)
