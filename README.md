# SpongeCreeperHeal

SpongeCreeperHeal is a *Work In Progress* project, source are now available but all feature are not implemented.
Currently SpongeCreeperHeal is not suitable to be deploy on real servers.
SpongeCreeperHeal is not only a porting of [ForgeCreeperHeal](https://github.com/RedRelay/ForgeCreeperHeal) from Forge to Sponge.

It is a complete code refactoring to make it easier to understand and to contribute.
SpongeCreeperHeal started 18th july 2018, at the same date of Minecraft 1.13 !

With a lot of new skill in develpment, I will put the best of I could in this plugin.

I don't use Java since 2017, I'm now a professionnal JavaScript devlopper for a leader e-commerce compagny in France.
As Minecraft is java coded, I will use Java with some functionnal programming I've learned from JS. E.g -> Lambda !

Damn I've done an other break since july 2018 and we are now in June 2019 .. and Minecraft 1.14 was released.
I agree I am not reliable. Sorry. In fact I don't play Minecraft since 2015 and sometimes I want to play again.
Theses times mean I code. Othertime I am a bit bored by Minecraft & Plugin developpement.

## When the code and the Sponge plugin will be available ?

I need to create a strong functionnal base before publishing the code.
Here is a base roadmap :

- [x] Implement a per chunk / per explosion blockSnapshots stucture
- [x] Handle tick and consume healable objects
- [x] Restore a blockSnapshot
- [x] Persist data
- [x] Create a dependency engine -> the hardest and main core feature
- [ ] Register all dependencies -> the longest step (tracker : https://github.com/RedRelay/SpongeCreeperHeal/issues/4)
- [ ] Configurable healing clock

When all theses task will be done, the code will be published.
I've planned additionnal develpments :

- [ ] Configurable filters on explosion sources
- [ ] Healing commands with permissions
- [ ] Simulate block healing when chunk is not loaded

Stay tuned :)
